                                                        How to use Automatic Sequences Analysis Tool
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Automatic Sequences Analysis Tool receives a proteic sequence as query and a data base file. Then it is performed a blast to find the top10 sequences that are more similar with the quey. After that it is performed a global alignment of all 11 sequences to draw a philogenetic tree and a graph.

On the MENU we can select to pick examples to understand better how the tool works and at the end start performing the analysis.


To run the Automatic Sequences Analysis Tool open the terminal in this directory and write:

                    python3 runMe.py


warning: 
    The program destinates to python version later than 3.0
    To write an option whenever is asked, don't use " " or ' ', it is not necessary!
    Make sure your query file have fasta format, like the example file in the folder: "source.fasta"
    Make sure your database file have text format, like the example file in the folder: "seqdump.txt"
    Make sure your substitution matrix is similar to the one in the folder: "blosum62.mat"


Features included in this tool:
    - Menu where you can select what you prefer to perform first
    - Examples to see how the tool works
    - Files for the examples: source.fasta as reference and seqdump.txt for database.
